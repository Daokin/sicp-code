        <h1>Code in 1986 SICP lectures</h1>

<h2>From MIT's 6.001, taught by Gerry Sussman and Hal Abelson.</h2>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/course?list=ECE18841CABEA24090">youtube classes from 1986</a> are available in 240p/360p, very poor quality for visualizing anything, much code. In addition to that, the camera won't fix the code for long, making it substantially harder to follow</p>

<p>using youtube version and timing (videos can also be found <a href="...">here</a>)!
In order of class' display (some of it)</p>

<h4>My objective with this project was to</h4>

<ul>
<li>  make slides easier to visualize</li>
<li>  and code easy to manipulate (as in case of copying what's written on the board)</li>
</ul><h2>Syntax and Notation</h2>

<p>maintain consistency in notation, comments, indentation etc
I essentially used the original indentation of the slides, except for when I was able to improve readability by changing it.
explain terminal syntax, comments notation, etc</p>

<p>Breaks and interruptions are also indicated.</p>

<p>=&gt;
$
...</p>

<h2>Notes and Observations</h2>

<p>Though the files have extension .scm, they present code from the board and literal content of the slides (some of which is code). They're expected not to compile in any scheme interpreter.</p>

<p>There are probably a few syntax errors deriving from the misplacement of parenthesis and mistyping of words.</p>

<p>I have added comments and notes throughout the code to help comprehension and attention to details.</p>

<p>The syntax and style are not consistent in all of the code, and I apologize for that. I believe to have refined the styling during the process of transcribing.</p>

<p>I have fixed the code on a few rare occasions. In all of them I've noted the correction using a colon followed by an exclamation mark. Notice that ';!' was also used, one or twice, in the lecture slides.</p>

<ul>
<li>  During lecture <a href="">7A</a> (the most epic lecture of all), <a href="http://youtu.be/0m6hoOelZH8?t=33m45s">33:45</a>, in the code for <code>assaq</code>, <code>car</code> should be changed to <code>caar</code>.
I didn't notice Sussman correcting it after showing the code. Geez.
I spotted the mistake while creating my version of the code and seeing that it didn't match the slides by that much. I recommend this practice of trying to write some of the functions beforehand.</li>
</ul><h2>Help is much appreciated!</h2>

<p>Things left to do:</p>

<ul>
<li>Normalize syntax and style across the transcription files.</li>
