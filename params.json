The videos are available in 240p/360p: very poor quality for visualizing the code in the slides. In addition to that, the camera won't fixate on the board for long, making it extremely difficult to follow. \r\n\r\n### This is a transcribed version of the full code featured in the lectures. ###\r\n\r\nThis project is intended to make the code and content in the lectures manipulable and readable, **unlike the slide below**:\r\n\r\n![Unreadable Slide](http://i.imgur.com/nin0M9n.png \"This is nearly impossible to read\")\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n## Files Syntax and Notation\r\n\r\nI tried to maintain consistency of notation, comments and indentation throughout the lectures. Much of the original indentation on the slides was maintained, except for when I was able to improve readability by changing it. Lecture breaks are also noted.\r\n\r\nEvery `SLIDE`, `TERMINAL` or `BOARD` content is presented, together with the time appearance. E.g.\r\n\t\r\n\t;# SLIDE 0:00:00\r\n\t    ... slide content\r\n\t;# END SLIDE\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n## Notes and Observations\r\n\r\n* I have added comments and remarks throughout the code to help comprehension.\r\n* Though all files have extension .scm, their content represent a literal transcription of the slides, some of which isn't code. **They're expected to fail to compile in all Scheme interpreters.**\r\n* I have fixed the code on a few, rare occasions. In all of them I've noted the correction using a colon followed by an exclamation mark. Notice that ';!' was also used, one or twice, in the lecture slides.\r\n\r\n#### A slide might have been ommited because\r\n-  it's extremely readable\r\n-  it's not code\r\n-  its content isn't \"textable\"\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nHelp is much appreciated!\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\n### Feel free to make an issue when spotting any errors in the transcription.\r\n#### Things left to do:\r\n- Standardize syntax and style across the transcription files.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nUseful Links\r\n------------\r\n- [Official SICP (book) website](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/)\r\n- [Sussman and Abelson's lectures - Official website](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/)\r\n- [Video lectures hosted by MIT (notice transcripts of the classes are available)](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/video-lectures/)\r\n- [Course notes from the 2005 lectures](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/lecture-notes/)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
