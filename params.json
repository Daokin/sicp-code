In addition to that, the camera wouldn't in fix the code for long, making it substantially harder to follow.\r\n\r\n### Using the youtube version (and timing), I have transcribed the code from the board and slide present in ALL classes to text format and published it here.\r\n\r\n### My objective with this project was to\r\n-\tmake slides easier to visualize\r\n-\tmake code easy to manipulate (no need to write transcribe what's seen in the video)\r\n\r\n\r\nSyntax and Notation\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nI tried to maintain consistency in notation, comments, indentation throughout the lectures, couldn't achieve that 100%. I essentially used the original indentation on the slides, except for when I was able to improve readability by changing it.\r\n\r\nEvery SLIDE, TERMINAL or BOARD content is presented contained the time of first display, in the following manner\r\n\t\r\n\t;# SLIDE 0:00:00\r\n\t...\r\n\t;# END SLIDE\r\n\r\nBreaks and interruptions are also indicated.\r\n\r\n=>\r\n$\r\n...\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes and Observations\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nComments by me were also added to help comprehension and attention to details\r\n\r\nThough the files have extension .scm, they present code from the board and literal content of the slides (some of which is code). They're expected not to compile in any scheme interpreter.\r\n\r\nThere are probably a few syntax errors deriving from the misplacement of parenthesis and mistyping of words.\r\n\r\nI have added comments and notes throughout the code to \r\n\r\nThe syntax and style are not consistent in all of the code, and I apologize for that. I believe to have refined the styling during the process of transcribing.\r\n\r\nI have fixed the code on a few rare occasions. In all of them I've noted the correction using a colon followed by an exclamation mark. Notice that ';!' was also used, one or twice, in the lecture slides.\r\n\r\n-\tDuring lecture [7A]() (the most epic lecture of all), [33:45](http://youtu.be/0m6hoOelZH8?t=33m45s), <strike>in the code for `assaq`, `car` should be changed to `caar`.<strike>\r\n\tI didn't notice Sussman correcting it after showing the code. Geez.\r\n\tI spotted the mistake while creating my version of the code and seeing that it didn't match the slides by that much. I recommend this practice of trying to write some of the functions beforehand.\r\n\r\n\r\nHelp is much appreciated!\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nThings left to do:\r\n- Normalize syntax and style across the transcription files.\r\n\r\n\r\nUseful Links\r\n------------\r\n\r\n-\t[Official SICP (book) website](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/)\r\n-\t[Official website for Sussman and Abelson's course](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/)\r\n-\t[These video lectures are also available at MIT OCW's website (notice the availability of transcripts)](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/video-lectures/)\r\n-\t[Course notes from the 2005 lectures](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/lecture-notes/)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
