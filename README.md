Code in 1986 SICP lectures
=====================

## From MIT's 6.001, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.

The youtube classes from 1986 are available in 240p/360p, very poor quality for visualizing code.
What I've done is 

Objective is make code easier to visualize and manipulate (as in case of copying what's written on the board).

maintain consistency in notation, comments, indentation etc

explain terminal syntax, comments notation, etc
=>
$
...


There are probably a few syntax errors deriving from the misplacement of parenthesis.
ToDo
- Syntax normalizer

; Writing some of the functions in uppercase might be against what is .. Confusion arising from naming primitives uppercase
; I mostly used the original indentation, except when I was able to improve readability by changing it.
; In order of class' display (some of it)
using youtube versions!

some of it might not compile directly, because of the notation used in the slides
