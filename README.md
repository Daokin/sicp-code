Code in SCIP lectures
=====================

## From MIT's 6.001, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.

The youtube classes from 1986 are available in 240p/360p, very poor quality for visualizing code.
What I've done is 

maintain consistency in notation, comments, indentation etc

ToDo
- Syntax normalizer

; Writing some of the functions in uppercase might be against what is .. Confusion arising from naming primitives uppercase
; I tried to use Sussman's original indentation... no i didnt
; In order of class' display (some of it)
using youtube versions!

some of it might not compile directly, because of the notation used in the slides
